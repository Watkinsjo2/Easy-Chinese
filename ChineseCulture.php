<h1><center>Facts About Chinese Culture</center></h1> 
<div class="boxed">

<p>	China is an old country. It has 5000 years of history, which leaves a great and abundant historical heritage. The Chinese language is very confusing and interesting for all Chinese speakers and people who want to learn Chinese. There is not just one language in China. This is the reason why many native Chinese have a love or hate relationship with the language. To understand this topic; one must explore the history and the current linguistic structure of the Chinese language in its homeland.</p>
<p>	<img src="maxresdefault.jpg" height="99" width="99" alt="Image" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;"> 
The history of the Chinese language is interesting for everyone with a passion for history because the Chinese writing system is one of the oldest known written languages. It also has a rich history that dates to 1122 BCE, many have conflicting notions of how the evolution of this language should be classified. The writing system has at least six thousand years of history. It is found in turtle shells dating back to the Shang dynasty; indicate the written language has existed for more than 3000 years.</p>

<p>	One of the most intriguing things about the Chinese language is the evolution of the character and spoken language. Many of Chinese characters evolved in the Shang Dynasty.  The Jia-gu wen is the earliest of Chinese symbols. They are etched onto turtle shells and animal’s bones.” It looks like pictures. For example, if one needs to use the word house, one draws a house and that is the character at that time. After Jia-gu wen, Da zhuan script appeared mostly on cast bronze vessels. Xiao zhuan is the elegant, flowing script of Chinese writing. This version of Chinese calligraphy was the predecessor for the more streamlined version of modern writing. This type of writing system is like art. Lis shu is the modern Chinese writing system, that is much easier to use with pens, brushes and paper, which is part of the reason it was adapted as the main Chinese calligraphic method. The Lis shu system is easier to use. This shows that the Chinese writing system is quite confusing yet interesting.</p>
<p>	There are two methods of Chinese writing, Wenyan method which uses the classical Chinese symbols, and baihua method which includes vernacular Chinese symbols. The two systems combine to bridge the gap between ancient Chinese writings and modern day vocabulary. This means those two writing systems aren’t much different.  People spoke a language also called “Archaic Chinese” that was primarily spoken during the Zhou Dynasty. It incorporated a variety of rich sounds but lacked many tonal elements, which means there are not specific or pitches around which the Chinese language was centered. The middle Chinese is found in the sixth Century, the Sui, Tang, and Song dynasties. The difference between the old and middle Chinese language was that they had significantly evolved and began taking on various forms in the same way that the growth and movement of the population triggered the development of early Chinese dialects. Ignoring the fifty-six official meliorated languages spoken in mainland China, there are still over a hundred dialects of Chinese. These dialects are very closely related and come from a common parent language.</p>
<p>	<img src="nope.png" height="99" width="99" alt="Image" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 0px 0px; border: 1px solid #000000;">The Chinese language was so confusing, and then scholars found out a way to make the Chinese language more understandable to the western world. China developed the “pinyin” system. The pinyin system used the western alphabet and spelling to pronounce Chinese words.  People also use pinyin learning to speak Mandarin Chinese. Zhou Youguang is generally regarded as the “Father of Hanyu Pinyin”. It is claimed that Chairman Mao like many others who had earlier eagerly embraced a Latin-based transliteration system, firmly believed that Hanyu Pinyin would completely replace all other forms of language, including traditional Chinese. During the Cultural Revolution Pinyin, had been used since its introduction.  In 1977, the “refinement” was completed and published. In 1982, Pinyin became the official standard for transcribing traditional Chinese. In 1986, Pinyin further met with utter rejection and after a few years that Pinyin reverted to its original 1949 form.</p>
<p>	From traditional to simplified Chinese, writing changes many people’s feeling of the Chinese language. The differences between traditional and simplified Chinese are interesting. Traditional Chinese contains more and more meanings, and is easy to understand by just looking at the words. Simplified Chinese is easier to write and easier to learn. The simplified system employed in the PRC is becoming more widely known outside of China. The traditional system is increasingly tolerated by those who used to insist strongly on implementing reform. Before 1960 or thereabouts, it would be inaccessible to a person who could not read traditional writing. They have a problem because simplified characters do not have a one-to-one correspondence to traditional characters. Classical Chinese characters are taught and used by Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, Japan, and elsewhere. Latin-based words are written from left to right, traditional Chinese texts are written in the same manner as Latin-based text. Chinese orthography or writing in columns from right to left and from top to bottom is still practiced in Taiwan. If the practice reflects a resistance to the language conventions of mainland China for ideological reasons, it will likely change in time, simply for practical reasons. Primarily Chinese in China uses simplified characters. It is taught in Mandarin-Chinese classes internationally as well. Those characters are simpler, i.e., has less pen-strokes than traditional Chinese characters.</p>
<p>	Mandarin Chinese is the main language in mainland China. Those characters are also called Hanzi. Hanzi has more than 50,000 symbols. This enormous amount of characters’ accounts, in part, for the high illiteracy rate in China. To circumvent this problem, the People’s Republic of China introduced a program to simplify the language into a set of commonly used characters. The current writing system uses approximately 6,000 of these characters.
Mandarin is “flat timbre” language with just tones. Those four tones always confuse people. Mandarin has four tones; they are “high, rising, falling-rising and falling. Most native Chinese call Mandarin, “Putonghua” This is the reason why people liken spoken Chinese to singing a song.</p>
<p>	Cantonese is the second largest language in China. The primary difference between Mandarin and Cantonese are the spoken language. Spoken Chinese has changed remarkably over the centuries, while Chinese writing system has changed little from the ancient Chinese. People who can understand only either Mandarin or Cantonese can communicate with each other by writing because they are using the same writing characters with a few exceptions. Cantonese speakers also developed an informal slang or phonetic characters. These characters are used in addition to traditional Chinese characters in an informal setting, such as in comics or entertainment sections of newspapers and magazines. Because these informal characters are not found in the dictionary people from China, Taiwan or other countries must learn to recognize then to read all sections of Hong Kong-based newspapers.</p>
<p>	The spoken language of Cantonese is totally different than Mandarin Chinese; Mandarin has four tones, and Cantonese has more than six tones. People from Hong Kong humorously call it “the chicken talking to the duck” because they cannot understand each other. Those two languages are both tonal languages with different tones having different meanings for the same sound.  They have different vowels and consonants, too. Many Mandarin consonants have no equivalent in Cantonese. Cantonese is spoken in Hong Kong, Canton, Guangdong province and southern Guangxi.</p>
<p>	Mandarin and Cantonese are just a part of Chinese Languages. There are many Chinese dialects. Dialects change with location. About one fifth of the world’s population is native speakers of Chinese. The Xiang dialect also known as Hunanese and is spoken primarily in the Hunan Province, located in southern China. The Min dialect is spoken mostly in Fujian, Taiwan and Hainan, and parts of eastern Guangdong and the Leizhou Bandao penisula, and in areas of Southeast Asia. Gan dialect is used mostly by the people living in Jiangxi and the southeastern corner of Hubei. They are located or the north side of China. The Wu dialect is spoken by most the people living in Zhijiang and the southern areas of Jiangsu and Anhui. The Kejia or Hakka dialect is spoken in the northeastern Guangdong area, southwestern Fujian, Southern Jiangxi, and in areas throughout southeastern China and Southeast Asia. In other words, Mandarin is the common denominator throughout China and various dialects are spoken in specific places.</p>

<p>	Cultural Chinese dialects are different. China is better described as a nation fragmented by a maze of dialects and languages than a country unified by a common tongue. In addition to the languages spoken by China’s 55 ethnic minorities, the Han Chinese, who make up 90 percent of the population of China, speak 1,500 dialects with the bulk of them spoken in the southern half of the country. The official view that these dialects are all variations of a common language is a view shaped more by politics than linguistics. The degree of difference among dialects is much higher than the degree of difference among European languages.</p>
<p>	Nearly all the languages spoken in China fall into three families; first is Sino-Tibetan, which includes Mandarin, Cantonese and the other Chinese dialects and languages; second is Miao-Yao, which includes the languages spoken by many hill tribes and ethnic groups scattered around southern China and Southeast Asia; and the last is Tai-Kadai, another family of tribal languages spoken in southern China and Southeast Asia. Some minorities in Western China speak languages related to Turkish and Finnish. Chinese is a Sino-Tibetan language. Sino-Tibetan languages predominate in China and mainland Southeast Asia. They are broken into three main subfamilies; Tibeto-Burman, Tai and Sinitic, including many of the language spoken in China. Sino-Tibetan languages are tonal, which means that the meaning of the word can change with the tone of pitch in which it is spoken. As is true with Vietnamese and Thai, Chinese words with the same basic sound can have different meanings depending on the way the tones of teh sound change.</p>

<p>	Chinese is a very difficult language to learn, either in writing system or the Pinyin system, but it also a very interesting language to learn, because learning a language is equal to learning a country, culture and history. To learn Chinese is to learn the history and geography of the country.  Though challenging, taking the journey through the culture and history of China is a great reward for the struggles of learning the language.</p>
